# School Angular Website Assignment

This is a very unfinished, very broken e-commerce website built with Angular and Bootstrap. Laravel is planned for the backend, but hasn't been touched yet. This project exists because it had to—not because I enjoy web development.

## 🧪 Status

- Frontend: Angular + Bootstrap (barely functional)
- Backend: Laravel (not implemented)
- UI: Responsive-ish
- UX: Questionable
- Stability: LOL

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Angular
- Bootstrap
- Laravel (eventually, maybe)

## 🚧 Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/gtRZync/school-angular-website-assignment.git
cd school-angular-website-assignment

# Install frontend dependencies
cd angular-front
npm install #maybe not needed

# Run the frontend
ng serve
```

## 🤷‍♂️ Why?

Because sometimes you just gotta build a website, even if you'd rather be deep in systems programming.
